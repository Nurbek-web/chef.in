## Development process

### Design and Data Flow

Before starting development, I created a comprehensive design and data flow for the system. This included outlining the user interface, database schema, and interaction between different components of the application. I have chosen Firebase, because it is best option for simple apps to speed up developement process. 

### Methodology

Throughout the development process, I followed a structured approach, breaking down tasks into manageable chunks and prioritizing them based on their importance and dependencies. I also made sure to regularly review and iterate on the design and implementation to ensure alignment with the project goals.

### Unique Approaches

One unique aspect of my approach is my ability to think and code quickly. This allowed me to efficiently implement features and iterate on them as needed.
Also, I optimized my web app with server side rendering; 

### Compromises and Challenges

I considered using my own API rather than given [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api), because I was planning adding recipe feature, but had some troubles with time.

#### Known Issues

No major issues with the app at the moment. I'll keep an eye out for any problems during development and testing.

#### Notes: I'm a student at Nazarbayev Intellectual School in 10th grade and typically study from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Had some issues with time management
